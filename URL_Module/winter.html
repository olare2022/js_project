<h1>Winter Period</h1>
<p>Winter time is the period of time when a country is not observing Daylight Saving Time (DST) and is using standard time. During winter time, clocks are usually set back one hour from standard time. <br>
Winter time is also known as normal time. It's commonly used in Europe, Scandinavia, Germany, and the Netherlands. Some countries that historically used DST, like Turkey, Morocco, and Egypt, also use winter time.<br> 
Kenya observes Eastern Africa Time all year and does not change clocks for DST</p>
