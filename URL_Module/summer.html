<h1>Summer</h1>
<p>Daylight saving time (DST), also referred to as daylight saving(s), <br>daylight savings time, daylight time (United States and Canada), or summer time (United Kingdom, European Union, and others), <br>is the practice of advancing clocks to make better use of the longer daylight available during summer so that darkness falls at a later clock time.<br> The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in spring or late winter, <br>and to set clocks back by one hour to standard time in the autumn (or fall in North American English, hence the mnemonic: "spring forward and fall back").</p>
